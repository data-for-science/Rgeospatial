# GIS with R Tutorial

This introduction to geospatial analysis and visualization in R will cover the following topics:

* Working with Vector Data
* Working with Raster Data
* Projections and Coordinate Transformations
* Subsetting, Clipping, and Cropping Data
* Making and Saving Maps

For an external resource, check out the textbook ["Geocomputation with R"](https://r.geocompx.org/) by Robin Lovelace and others. I derived some of the following excercises from the book.

Please work your way through the tutorial and ask any questions you may have!

P.S.
This document was generated using R Markdown. This is a great tool for code transparency  and data analysis, because the code blocks, code outputs, and your comments are "knitted" into a single document! Ask us more about this

## What is a GIS, and what are geospatial data?

A GIS or Geographic Information System stores, organizes, manages, creates, processes, analyzes ... or does anything to geospatial data! When you create a map, you are most likely using a GIS software to bring in all your data to layer multiple types of information. But before you ever create a map, you often need to process, alter, combine, analyze several data streams to reveal some meaning or answer a question. Sometimes you use a GIS to alter geospatial data so heavily, it ends up being just a number! But it's always important to understand and visualize where data came from, and especially the characteristics of that data, including resolution, accuracy, age, frequency, and other assumptions.

![Example of Geospatial Data](https://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/geographic-information-system-basics/section_05/f2619b76bb0d1d0f74b0e8d80ba33496.jpg){width=33%}
The best data we have are still abstractions of the real world. We are limited by the resolution of our data. The major tenant of GIS is drawing conclusions about the world based on spatial/topological relationships and distributions.

Some example questions we might ask using a GIS:
*What is the shortest route from me to the pizza store? 
*How does rainfall vary with elevation?
*What land use is most frequented by the Eastern Bluebird?
*What is the nearest fire hydrant to a house fire?

In your every-day life, you use web platforms like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to examine data or calculate how you move about the world.

The image above includes the 2 primary types of geospatial data: VECTOR and RASTER.

## Map Possibilities with R

The following images were made using R! They're at large geographic scales, but there are so many beautiful opportunities for all scales and data types. The freedom and curse with making maps is unlimited ways to slightly tweak, adjust, emphasize components of the data and labeling. Effective map making is an art form.

## Importance of Projection

As any introductory GIS course covers, stretching the earth onto a flat surface results in some distortion. 

![Earth as a Balloon](https://previews.123rf.com/images/altomedia/altomedia0805/altomedia080500007/3010547-planet-earth-balloon-inflated-and-deflated.jpg){width=50%}
The Mercator Projection is what you most commonly see on wall maps and in platforms like Google. While it has major navigational benefits, it distorts area to an increasing amount as you move from the equator to the poles. This results in the common misconception of the *true* size of many countries. In particular, many large northern countries (e.g. USA, Canada, Europe, Russia, China) appear very large compared to equatorial countries.

The following image shows several countries with correct areas (but angular distortion).

![Deceiving Size](https://i.redd.it/u330vr220dm51.png){width=33%}

While the Mercator projection is the most common in classrooms, there are infinite possibilities that prioritize different geographic regions or map characteristics. 

![XKCD Map Projections](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/map_projections.png){width=25%}
While there are aesthetic reasons to pick a certain projection for your final map, having an understanding and proper accounting of the projections used with your data is critical to make sure any analysis is comparing "apples to apples". If you combine data from a Mercator and Albers Equal Area projection, you'll end up with nonsense! We will explore this more in the workshop.

## GIS Operations

In this workshop, in addition to making several maps, we'll cover several basic GIS operations. A nonexhaustive list of operations is as follows:
* (union)[https://gisgeography.com/union-tool/]
* (merge)[https://gisgeography.com/merge-tool-gis/]
* (join)[https://gisgeography.com/spatial-join/]
* (dissolve)[https://gisgeography.com/dissolve-tool-gis/]
* (buffer)[https://gisgeography.com/buffer-tool-gis/]
* (intersect)[https://gisgeography.com/intersect-tool-gis/]
* (clip/mask)[https://gisgeography.com/clip-tool-gis/]
* subset
* extract

![Clip Tool](https://gisgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Clip-Tool-768x243.png)
![Dissolve Tool](https://gisgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dissolve-Tool-678x228.png)

Visualizations of geospatial operations are helpful, but many of the differences between tools reflect how they handle *information* related to the shapes we see. Tools can be regarded as *adding* or *subtracting* information, complexity, and spatial extent. I've provided a table below describing how these tools manipulate data. We will refer to these tools throughout the workshop.

```{r show table,echo=FALSE,results="asis"}
knitr::kable(read.csv("data/GISTools.csv"))
```

Let's get started!



## Adjust Settings, Load Packages 
In order to equip R with functionality for gis data, we need to load or install several packages. Because this is an intermediate+ workshop, I have code written in sometimes complicated formats, but I will do my best to explain what I am doing. There are many ways to do the same thing in R. Similarly, there are many different packages in R that can handle the same types of data. We will use the pairing of the *tmap* and *sf* packages. We'll load several other packages we'll use. In particular, the *spData* package contains lots of open-source geospatial data that we can use! For the most current version, we need to access the github code repository for *spDataLarge*. A list of data is here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spData/spData.pdf
```{r setup2,message=FALSE}
#this is a custom function that that can load multiple packages at once
loadpackages=function(packages){  for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p,character.only=T)){install.packages(p)}
  # IF require returns FALSE, the package is missing and will be installed
  library(p,character.only=T,quietly=T,verbose=F)
  # next, it calls the package with library
  }} 


loadpackages(c(
           "tmap", # Thematic Map Visualization, makes maps!
           "ggplot2", # Makes ggplots! Can also make maps
           "sf",   # "Simple Features", handles vector data
           "raster", # For working with Raster Data
           "terra", # A newer package for working with Raster data
           "ggrepel", # Labels on ggplots
           "plyr", # The split-apply-combine paradigm
           "data.table", # Works with data.frames
           "dplyr", # Data manipulation
           "purrr", # Functional Programming Tools
           "devtools", # Download custom R packages
           "spData" # Spatial Datasets
           ))

if(!require("dfsspatdat",character.only=T)){
  options(timeout = 400) # Download time may approach 400 seconds
  devtools::install_github("data-for-science/dfs_spatdat")
}
# devtools::install_github installs a package from its github directory
library(dfsspatdat)

if(!require("spDataLarge",character.only=T)){
  devtools::install_github("Nowosad/spDataLarge")
}
library(spDataLarge)
```

# Section 1: Working with Vector Data

We'll start this tutorial with a dataset that should look familiar: borders of the World's countries. 

## Examining Geospatial Vector Data

From the start, let's examine some of the open-source geospatial data that comes with the *spData* package. 

The *world* dataset contains shapefiles for 177 countries. We can take *dim* of *world* to see that like a data frame, it contains data in 177 rows, and has 11 columns. *names* of *world* tells us there are attributes for each shape such as name, which we would expect, some regional data, and demographics, including population, life expectancy, and gross domestic product per capita. Finally, the column **geom** contains the information that makes this object time different than just a regular data frame. 

```{r Examine World}
data("world")
dim(world) # take the 'dimensions' of the object, returns rows and columns
names(world) # gives column names of object
```

When we call for *head* of *world*, we can see data for several countries in Africa and North America. We also see an interesting series of 6 lines printed ahead of what looks like a regular data frame. We see that *head* has returned what it calls a "Simple feature collection with 6 features and 10 fields". Note, it considers the 10 fields as the 11 columns but minus the geom column. We can also see a *bbox* field defining the geographic extent of the data, and the final two lines showing us data on the data *projection*. We'll come to projections in a moment.

```{r Examine World2}
head(world) # return top 6 items/rows of an object
```

If we're enthusiastic about it, we can try right away to plot our map of the world!
Try just using base R *plot*.
```{r plot world}
plot(world)
```

...huh, so this isn't quite what we wanted. Since the world data appeared to us like a data frame, base R appears to try to plot *all* the data within it. We could try to have it plot only one series of data though.

```{r plot world2}
plot(world$geom)
```

This is closer to what we expected. Of course, we're hoping to make maps visualizing some sort of data. To get there, we need to figure out how geospatial data in R is differentiated from accompanying data (statistics, categories, names, etc.).


## Plotting World borders with tmap

Instead of base plot, let's use tmap to visualize the world shapefile. 

tmap is an exciting package for geospatial data visualization. The package is covered extensively in the book [*Geocomputation with R*](https://r.geocompx.org/) by Robin Lovelace and others. 

The tmap style of data visualization and map making uses declarative coding: similar to using ggplot.

Each object will be wrapped in a call to tm_shape(), followed by the desired geometry type (e.g., tm_borders, tm_fill, tm_polygons)

```{r plotworld}
tmap_arrange(
  tm_shape(world)+tm_borders(),
  tm_shape(world)+tm_fill(),
  nrow=1
)
```

```{r plotworld2}
tmap_arrange(
  tm_shape(world)+tm_borders()+tm_fill(col="pop"),
  tm_shape(world)+tm_borders()+tm_fill(col="pop",style="log10_pretty"),
  nrow=1
)
```

If you are familiar with ggplot and declaritive plotting, the formatting of aesthetics will be familiar. Call the column/variable by name in quotations to specify what is mapped to an attribute (e.g, color, fill, shape, linetype).

With the pop layer as the fill aesthetic, we see a dramatic bright blue color in China and India. We can improve the scaling of this variable by showing color as the log of population. This shows a dramatic pathwork of population sizes across South America, Africa, and Asia as well. 


We can also fill the color with a categorical value like region.
```{r tmapworld3}
tm_shape(world)+tm_fill(col="region_un")
```

Earlier, we commented how this geospatial data object behaved a bit like a dataframe. We can in fact operate on this object with many functions we often use with dataframes!

For example, we can *subset* the world dataset to plot only the boundary of Canada. Think earlier when we discussed geospatial operations. We can create a new object called Canada. We've reduced the amount of information and spatial extent relative to the world object: we no longer have information about any countries besides Canada. But, we've kept the information type the same: it's still a polygon.
```{r tmapCanada}
tm_shape(shp=subset(world,name_long=="Canada"))+tm_borders()
Canada = subset(world,name_long=="Canada")
head(Canada)
```

## Plotting World borders with ggplot2

With spatial objects, aesthetics (*aes*) are set the same as in other ggplots. We can fill by a variable if inside aes(), and values outside aes will apply to the shape.

```{r ggplotworld}
ggplot(data=world,aes(fill=pop))+geom_sf() # alter shape fill by population
ggplot(data=subset(world,name_long=="Canada"))+geom_sf(color=2)
ggplot(data=world,aes(fill=region_un))+geom_sf()
ggplot(data=world,aes(fill=log10(pop)))+ # alter shape fill by log10 of population
  geom_sf()+
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colors=c("blue","red"), # two end members of color gradient
    limits=c(7,9.3), # max and min of scale
    breaks=7:9, # breaks values for the plot legend
    labels=10^c(7:9), # show labels as 10 to the power of 7 through 9
    na.value="blue" # color for values outside limits()
  )
```


Challenge: create the following plots:

Did I subset by a particular region, or just a group of countries?

```{r tmap2}
tm_shape(shp=subset(world,name_long%in%c("Canada","United States","Mexico")))+tm_borders()
tm_shape(shp=subset(world,subregion=="Eastern Asia"))+tm_fill(col="gray")+tm_borders(lwd=2)
```

## Beneath the Trunk: Vector Shapes from Scratch

```{r circle-wat}
point.wat= data.frame(
    lon=-80.516670,
    lat=43.466667
    ) %>%
  sf::st_as_sf(.,coords=names(.),crs = 4326)

circle.wat = data.frame(angle = seq(0,360,1))
radius = 0.1 #decimal degrees

circle.wat$lon = radius*cos(2*pi*circle.wat$angle/360) +
  st_coordinates(point.wat)[,"X"]
circle.wat$lat = radius*sin(2*pi*circle.wat$angle/360) +
  st_coordinates(point.wat)[,"Y"]
circle.wat = subset(circle.wat,select=-c(angle))

circle.wat = circle.wat %>% 
  as.matrix() %>%
  list() %>%
  st_polygon() %>%
  st_sfc() %>%
  st_sf(., crs = 4326)

tm_shape(circle.wat)+
  tm_borders()+
  tm_shape(point.wat)+
  tm_dots(size=0.1)
```

```{r circle-wat-osm}
#library(OpenStreetMap)
osmtiles <- tmaptools::read_osm(
  tmaptools::bb(circle.wat), type="osm")
tm_shape(osmtiles)+
  tm_rgb(saturation = 0)+
  tm_shape(circle.wat)+
  tm_borders()+
  tm_shape(point.wat)+
  tm_dots(size=0.1)
```


```{r}
circlefx = function(center,radius){
  circle = data.frame(angle = seq(0,360,1))
  circle$lon = radius*cos(2*pi*circle$angle/360) + st_coordinates(center)[,"X"]
  circle$lat = radius*sin(2*pi*circle$angle/360) + st_coordinates(center)[,"Y"]
  circle = subset(circle,select=-c(angle))
  circle = circle %>% as.matrix() %>% list() %>%
    st_polygon() %>% st_sfc() %>% st_sf(., crs = 4326)
  return(circle)
}
```


# Section 2: Reviewing Map and Shape Projections

Let's explore what our data tells us about its projection type. *st_crs* queries the coordinate reference information for the shapefile. We see two data types: the EPSG code and the proj4string. EPSG stands for European Petroleum Survey Group, and is an internationally recognized numeric code defining the coordinate reference system or **CRS**. The proj4string shares the same information, but in text format. From this we can see that the data are projected according to the World Geodetic System of 1984, in latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates.

```{r stcrs}
st_crs(world)
st_crs(world)$proj4string
```

## Reprojecting Vector Data


So far we've been looking at the world through the Mercator Projection. We'll use the pipe to pass world to *st_transform* and specify several different proj4 strings.

```{r projections}
projMollweide="+proj=moll +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"
projRobinson="+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6371000 +b=6371000 +units=m +no_defs"
projGallPeters="+proj=cea +lon_0=0 +lat_ts=45 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"


tmap_arrange(
  tm_shape(
      world,
      crs =projMollweide)+
    tm_borders()+
    tm_layout(title = "Mollweide"),
  tm_shape(
      world,
      crs =projRobinson)+
    tm_borders()+
    tm_layout(title = "Robinson Sphere"),
  tm_shape(
      world,
      crs =projGallPeters)+
    tm_borders()+
    tm_layout(title = "Gall-Peters Orthographic"),
  nrow=1
)
```

## Reproject Canada

We've analyzed the population data contained in the world shapefile. We can also modify the shapefile itself. We will re-project the shapefile from a the Ellipsoid WGS84 projection to the Canada Albers Equal Area Conic Projection. I find this much more visually appealing for Canada.

```{r Canada}
Proj_AEA_Can=c("+proj=aea +lat_1=50 +lat_2=70 +lat_0=40 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 ",
       "+ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs")%>%paste0(.,collapse = "")
# Canada Albers Equal Area Conic Projection
# visit http://spatialreference.org/ref/esri/canada-albers-equal-area-conic/proj4/
CanadaAEA=world%>%
  subset(.,name_long=="Canada")%>%
  st_transform(.,Proj_AEA_Can)
tm_shape(CanadaAEA)+
  tm_borders()
```

# Section 3: Geospatial Operations

Let's review the geospatial operations discussed at the beginning of our workshop.

```{r show table,echo=FALSE,results="asis"}
knitr::kable(read.csv("Lectures_and_Slides/images/GISTools.csv"))
```

We jumped right in and starting doing subsets, partly because we saw that vector shapefiles in R behave and can be manipulated similarly to data frames. The other operations mostly have functions that come from the geospatial packages (e.g. sf, raster, terra, stars). 

## Operations: Merge, Union, Dissolve, Intersect

```{r circles}
point.wat= data.frame(lon=-80.516670, lat=43.466667) %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf(.,coords=names(.),crs = 4326)
circle.wat = circlefx(point.wat,0.3)

point.glp= data.frame(lon=-80.250000, lat=43.549999) %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf(.,coords=names(.),crs = 4326)
circle.glp = circlefx(point.glp,0.3)

tm_shape(circle.wat)+
  tm_borders()+
  tm_shape(circle.glp)+
  tm_borders()

# personally, I like that ggplots default to a map-view to encompass ALL polygons
# tmap defaults to a map view to encompass the first polygon
ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=circle.wat,fill="transparent")+
  geom_sf(data=circle.glp,fill="transparent")
```

### Merge

We see with merge that the two shapes just become grouped into one new object. We can imagine if these shapes had attributes, that to "rbind" them as we would data frames, they must have the same structure of columns and names.

```{r circle-merge}
circle.mrg = rbind(
  circle.wat,
  circle.glp
)

dim(circle.mrg)
circle.mrg

ggplot()+geom_sf(data=circle.mrg,fill="transparent")
```

### Union

Confusingly, the function for a traditional "union" is st_combine, not st_union. We see by passing the merged shape to st_combine, the output is a single MULTIPOLYGON with preserved internal boundaries.

```{r circle-union}
circle.un = sf::st_combine(
  circle.mrg
)

dim(circle.un)
circle.un

ggplot()+geom_sf(data=circle.un,fill="transparent")
```

### Dissolve

Confusingly, the function for a traditional "dissolve" is st_union. We see by passing the merged shape to st_union., the output is a single MULTIPOLYGON with dissolved internal boundaries.

```{r circle-dissolve}
circle.dis = sf::st_union(
  circle.mrg
)

dim(circle.dis)
circle.dis

ggplot()+geom_sf(data=circle.dis,fill="transparent")
```

### Intersection

Confusingly, the function for a traditional "dissolve" is st_union. We see by passing the merged shape to st_union., the output is a single MULTIPOLYGON with dissolved internal boundaries.

```{r circle-intersection}
circle.int = sf::st_intersection(
  circle.wat,
  circle.glp
)

dim(circle.int)
circle.int

ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=circle.dis,lty=2,col="red")+
  geom_sf(data=circle.int,lwd=2,col=1,fill="transparent")
```

## Operation: Intersection

Let's examine some new data, and learn a few more operations

```{r worldcities}
data("worldcities")

head(worldcities)
```
In the dfsspatdat package, the world cities point shapefile has lots of useful information associated with each city, but imagine we started out without knowing any of the countries the cities were in. Given only the coordinates of the cities, we could perform an intersect with the world object to retrieve the countries!

```{r intersection}
capitals_lost = subset(worldcities,
                          featurecla == "Admin-0 capital",
                          select=c(nameascii,geometry))

# test for same projection!
sf::st_crs(capitals_lost) == sf::st_crs(world)

# an intersection can be performed with st_intersection()
capitals_lost = sf::st_intersection(
  capitals_lost,
  subset(world,select=c(name_long,geom))
  )

head(capitals_lost)
```

## Operation: Dissolve

So refering back to our map of Canada earlier, I become very picky about the weird border down the middle of the Great Lakes. I like my maps to represent the landmass of Canada! 

```{r can_pretty}
data("can_prov",package="dfsspatdat")

head(can_prov)
can_prov$Country = "Canada"

#can_pretty = dplyr::summarise(can_prov)
can_pretty = can_prov |>
  dplyr::group_by(Country) |>
  dplyr::summarise()

head(can_pretty)

can_pretty = can_pretty |>
  sf::st_simplify(
  preserveTopology = TRUE,
  dTolerance = 500)

tmap_arrange(
  tm_shape(can_prov)+tm_borders(),
  tm_shape(can_pretty)+tm_borders(),
  nrow=1
)
```

There isn't a meaningful difference in run-time to perform a dissolve.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  can_pretty = sf::st_union(can_prov)
})
# Workstation Computer
#   user   system elapsed 
#   18.42  1.44   30.31 
# Laptop
#   user   system elapsed 
#   48.41  1.46   148.17 
system.time({
  can_pretty = dplyr::summarise(can_prov)
})
# Workstation Computer
#   user   system elapsed 
#   17.55  0.70   32.11 
# Laptop
#   user   system elapsed 
#   47.97  1.86   149.20
```


## Operation: Join


Despite the new object can_pretty seeming pretty devoid of information, there are lots of different geometries present. We know Canada has lots of islands, so they must be wrapped up inside the MULTIPOLYGON. We can get them out, if we wanted!

```{r}
can_singles = sf::st_cast(can_pretty,"POLYGON")

nrow(can_singles)

head(can_singles)
```

How might we know which is which? Which islands are part of which provinces?

```{r}
can_singles$Index = seq_len(nrow(can_singles))
can_single_centroids = sf::st_centroid(can_singles)
can_single_centroids = sf::st_intersection(
  can_single_centroids,
  subset(can_prov,select=c("PRENAME","geometry")))

can_singles = dplyr::left_join(
  can_singles,
  st_drop_geometry(can_single_centroids),
  by = join_by("Country","Index")
  )

table(can_singles$PRENAME)
```

Was this successful?

```{r islands_provinces}
tm_shape(can_singles)+
  tm_fill(col = "PRENAME")
```
How else might we identify very prominent islands in Canada?

```{r}
can_cities = subset(worldcities,sov0name=="Canada")
sf::st_crs(can_cities) == sf::st_crs(can_singles)
can_cities = sf::st_transform(can_cities,sf::st_crs(can_singles))

can_cities = sf::st_intersection(
  subset(can_cities,select=c(nameascii,featurecla,adm1name,geometry)),
  subset(can_singles,select=-c(PRENAME))
)

can_singles = dplyr::right_join(
  can_singles,
  sf::st_drop_geometry(can_cities),
  by = join_by("Country","Index")
)

```


```{r some_islands}
tmap_arrange(
  tm_shape(subset(can_singles,nameascii=="Victoria"))+
    tm_borders()+
    tm_shape(subset(can_cities,nameascii=="Victoria"))+
    tm_dots(size = 1)+
    tm_layout(title="Victoria, British Columbia"),
  tm_shape(subset(can_singles,nameascii=="St. John's"))+
    tm_borders()+
    tm_shape(subset(can_cities,nameascii=="St. John's"))+
    tm_dots(size = 1)+
    tm_layout(title="St. John's, Newfoundland"),
  tm_shape(subset(can_singles,nameascii=="Charlottetown"))+
    tm_borders()+
    tm_shape(subset(can_cities,nameascii=="Charlottetown"))+
    tm_dots(size = 1)+
    tm_layout(title="Charlottetown, PEI"),
  nrow=1
)
```


## Operation: Buffer

How many cities are within 200 kilometers of Toronto?

```{r}
can_cities = subset(worldcities,sov0name=="Canada",
                     select=c(nameascii,featurecla,adm1name,pop_max,geometry))
can_cities = sf::st_transform(can_cities,Proj_AEA_Can)

# Section 4: Map Aesthetics

Let's add a few map elements inherited from the *tmap* package. We'll  add a north arrow and scale bar, and we can get rid of the grid lines. If you wanted the axes and coordinates, you can adjust the parameters of tm_layout().


```{r tmapelements}
map=tm_shape(CanadaAEA)+tm_polygons()+
  tm_layout(title="Map of Canada")+
  tm_compass(type="arrow",position = c("right","top"))+
  tm_scale_bar(breaks=c(0,1000,2000),position = c("left","bottom"),text.size = 0.7)
map+tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
map+tm_layout(frame=TRUE)+tm_grid(projection = "+proj=longlat")
```


## Joining data
*spData* comes with data on where our coffee comes from! Use *left_join* from *dplyr* to add this data to world. Use the Robinson Sphere to accentuate the equatorial belt. We'll use the *st_centroid* function nested within *st_coordinates* and *cbind* to add X and Y coordinates to draw labels. We may only want labels for the top coffee contributing countries, so we can use subset.

```{r coffeemap}
data("coffee_data")
head(coffee_data)

  # spData tells us production is in units of thousands of 60 kg bags produced by country
  # multiple by 60kg/bag to get kg and divide by 10^3 to get metric tons
coffee_data$coffee_MT_2017 = coffee_data$coffee_production_2017*60/1000

world_coffee=world%>% 
  subset(.,select=c(name_long)) %>% 
  # pass to left_join, join by "name_long"
  left_join(.,coffee_data,by="name_long")%>% 
  st_transform(.,
       "+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6371000 +b=6371000 +units=m +no_defs"
               ) %>% 
  cbind(.,st_coordinates(st_centroid(.))) # add coordinates of centroids to data

tm_shape(world_coffee)+
  tm_fill(col="coffee_MT_2017")

ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=world_coffee,aes(fill=coffee_MT_2017))+
  geom_label_repel( # label the countries
    data=subset(world_coffee,coffee_production_2017>500), # take top coffee producers
    aes(x=X,y=Y,label=name_long), # label aesthetics
                   box.padding = 1, # distance between label and point
                   segment.size=1 # line width
                   )+
  scale_fill_gradientn(name=expression(paste(10^6,"kg coffee ",yr^-1)),
                       # complex text made with expression
    colors=c("lightgray","brown"),
    na.value="white" # value for countries with no data?
    )+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", # where to place the legend
        panel.background = element_blank(), # remove panel background
        axis.title=element_blank() # remove all axis titles
        )+
  ggtitle("World Coffee Production") # add a title
```

Think about what geospatial operation happened here. We took the world data, and added information that wasn't there before! So we increased the amount of information, but kept data for all the countries, even though only some can produce coffee. In many cases with *joins*, you have one geospatial object being joined with new information in a tabular format. There are cases where you will join information from two or more sets of geospatial objects, but this can quickly become chaotic. 

# Section 5. Working with Raster Data
## Raster Data Format

The eBird project has multiple data products that can be used for academic research or hobby science. I have down-sized some data from the Status and Trends dataset for two bird species: the Eastern Bluebird and the Bobolink. Use the *raster* function to read in a raster. These data are for occurrence frequency on an annual scale.  

```{r ebird1}
data("easblu_on",package = "dfsspatdat")
data("boboli_on",package = "dfsspatdat")
```

There are many many different types of raster file formats. The raster package is wonderful in that it can read in almost all of them. (Read more information on raster files)[https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/imagery/supported-raster-dataset-file-formats.htm]. 

Like we did when we first started examining the world shape, let's just call our raster object to see its description:

```{r ebird2}
easblu_on
```

There's useful information here: we see that there are 770 thousand data points in this raster. The crs of the data is pre-defined, and we can see it is the Canada Albers Equal Area Conic Projection, with units of metres. 

## Plotting Raster Data

We can use the basic plot function to try to examine the data. With basic plot, we can add the Ontario border.

```{r ebird3}
data("can_prov",package="dfsspatdat")
Ontario = subset(can_prov,PRENAME=="Ontario")
Ontario = sf::st_transform(Ontario,sf::st_crs(easblu_on))

plot(easblu_on,xlim=c(800000,1800000),ylim=c(260000,900000))
plot(Ontario$geometry,add=TRUE,main="Eastern Bluebird\nAnnual Frequency")
```

### Plot Aesthetics, Multiple Objects with tmap

As we saw earlier, options to plot geospatial data include base plot, ggplot, and tmap. For plotting both raster and vector data, tmap has made this much easier than ggplot. 

A note about zooming plots:
* Base plot uses xlim and ylim as arguments in plot
* ggplot uses +coord_sf(xlim=...,ylim=...) to set coordinates for maps
* tmap uses a more confusing format, where you must create a bounding box (bbox) object, to be fed to the tm_shape() function.

A note about layering objects with tmap:
* In ggplot, to layer objects like we did with the coffee plot above, you simply add (+) them on top of each other. In the coffee plot, we had +geom_sf() and some aesthetics to plot our countries, color coded by coffee production, and we added the +geom_label_repel() function to add a second feature, which were labels attached to the centroid points of a subset of countries. 
* In tmap, each object addition needs two sequential lines: first, a call of tm_shape() listing the object, and then a mapping function (e.g. tm_raster, tm_borders, tm_polygons) that corresponds with the object type.

```{r raster + vector plot}
sOntbbox = tmaptools::bb(
  sf::st_bbox(c(
  xmin = 800000,
  xmax = 1800000,
  ymin = 260000,
  ymax = 900000
  ),crs = sf::st_crs(easblu_on))
)

tm_shape(easblu_on,is.main = TRUE,bbox=sOntbbox)+
  tm_raster(palette = "Spectral",title = "Annual Frequency")+
  tm_shape(Ontario)+
  tm_borders()+
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right","center"),
            main.title = "Eastern Bluebird")

```



```{r ebird Bobolink}
bobo_freq <- rasterToContour(boboli_on,maxpixels = 10000,nlevels=4)
class(bobo_freq)

tm_shape(boboli_on,bbox=sOntbbox)+
  tm_raster(palette = "Spectral",title = "Annual Frequency")+
  tm_shape(Ontario)+
  tm_borders()+
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right","center"),
            main.title = "Bobolink")

```
## Multiband Raster Data

Here's a fun excercise: map the Flag of Canada in the shape of the country. Earlier we discussed raster formats. If you think about it, common file types you interact with every day (e.g. png, jpeg) are actually rasters!

```{r flag1}
CAFlag1 = raster(
  system.file("data-shp/CanadaFlag.png", package = "dfsspatdat")
)
CAFlag1
plot(CAFlag1)
```

Ok, so we didn't get anything inteligible from our plot. But the description of this raster object CAFlag1 gives us some clues: there is a range of values from 0 to 255, which is the maximum intensity of a pixel in a png file. The description also tells us there are multiple bands in this png file. If you know how computer images and screens work, you might guess that the different bands map onto the Red Green Blue (RGB) colors in the file.

Since there are multiple bands, we can instead use raster::stack to read in the data. 

```{r flag2}
CAFlag=raster::stack(
  system.file("data-shp/CanadaFlag.png", package = "dfsspatdat")
)
names(CAFlag)
# A portable network graphic (PNG) file stores image color in four bands, and we see 
#    that each band has 600 by 1200 cells
plot(CAFlag)
```

So now to test your knowledge of color theory, which of the bands map to red, green, and blue?


The bands are actually in order! From red (1), green (2), to blue (3). In the maple leaf shape, only red is at maximum intensity, so it will be red. In the band around the leaf, all three colors are at maximum intensity, so the resulting mixture will create white.

Let's combine these bands as intended to be seen on a computer: with an RGB plotting function.

```{r flag3}
raster::plotRGB(CAFlag,r=1,g=2,b=3)
# we see that the first band stores the red data, green in the 2nd, and blue in the 3rd.
```

We've spent time on color theory, but let's come back to GIS. This excercise serves to show you how to map non-geospatial data. Here, we'll re-map the flag's coordinates to latitude and longitude instead of its pixel dimensions.

```{r flag4}
Canada=subset(world,name_long=="Canada")

extent(CAFlag)<-extent(Canada)
crs(CAFlag)<-st_crs(Canada)$proj4string
# set coordinates for our CAFlag image the same as our geospatial data

tm_shape(CAFlag$CanadaFlag_2,is.main = TRUE)+
  tm_raster(col="CanadaFlag_2",palette = c("red","white"))+
  #     fill the raster by the value of the green band, 
  #     but specify the end color values of red and white
  tm_layout(bg.color = "gray",legend.show = F)+
  tm_shape(Canada)+
  tm_borders()

```

## Modifying Raster Data: Mask

Maybe we have a dataset at a larger scale than our area of interest. Or maybe we just want an aesthetically pleasing map with data contained to an area of interest (as a vector polygon). So far in this workshop, we haven't performed any subtractive geospatial operations on vector data. Here, we'll use the "mask" function to remove the flag information from outside of Canada's land border.

```{r flag mask}
CAFlagM=raster::mask(CAFlag,Canada) # we will mask out the parts of our image outside Canada

tm_shape(CAFlagM$CanadaFlag_2)+
  tm_raster(col="CanadaFlag_2",palette=c("red","white"))+
  #     fill the raster by the value of the green band, 
  #     but specify the end color values of red and white
  tm_layout(bg.color = "gray",legend.show = F)+
  tm_shape(Canada)+
  tm_borders()
```

These last graphs might have you thinking in the back of your head that this isn't the shape you're used to seeing for Canada. This is the effect of map projection. The last plot is shown using the Mercator projection, using longitude and latitude as coordinates.

## Projections and Raster Data

Let's revisit our flag, and see how changing the projection of our shapefile has changed several previously linear features. We'll use *projectRaster* to use our original raster and *transform* or *project* the data to a new CRS. Remember, an important principal of working with GIS data is that all data you're working with are in the same CRS when analyzing and plotting.

```{r flag project}
tm_shape(CAFlagM$CanadaFlag_2,is.master = TRUE,projection = Proj_AEA_Can)+
  tm_raster(col="CanadaFlag_2",palette=c("red","white"))+
  tm_layout(bg.color = "gray",legend.show = F)+
  tm_shape(Canada)+tm_borders()
```

## More Raster Practice: Multiband Imagery

Let's explore some data built into *spDataLarge*. We have access to a Digital Elevation Model from Zion National Park in Utah, USA.
```{r DEM}
zion_dem=system.file("raster/srtm.tif", package = "spDataLarge")%>%raster()
zion_shp=system.file("vector/zion.gpkg", package = "spDataLarge")%>%st_read()%>%st_transform(.,proj4string(zion_dem))

plot(zion_dem,main="Zion NP Elevation")
```

We see the map coordinates in latitude and longitude, and elevation by color. We just used base plot to show this raster. Use tmap to plot the dem with the Zional National Park boundary. *terrain.colors* provides a nice color pallete for elevation maps, with white highest and green lowest.

```{r DEM2}
zion_dem_mask=zion_dem%>%
  raster::crop(.,extent(zion_shp))%>%
  raster::mask(.,zion_shp)

tm_shape(zion_dem_mask)+
  tm_raster(style="cont",palette = terrain.colors(5),title="Elev (m)")+
  tm_shape(zion_shp)+tm_borders()+
  tm_layout(main.title="Zion NP Elevation",
            legend.position = c("right","top"))+
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom"))
```

We also have satellite imagery taken over this area! The data we have from the Landsat satellites has optical data in 4 color bands: 

* Blue	0.452 - 0.512	nm
* Green	0.533 - 0.590 nm
* Red	0.636 - 0.673	nm
* Near Infrared (NIR)	0.851 - 0.879 nm

We can visualize all four bands:

```{r landsat}
landsat = system.file("raster/landsat.tif", package = "spDataLarge") %>%
  brick()

zion_shp=st_transform(zion_shp,crs(landsat))

plot(landsat)
```

To put them together, we will use the *tm_rgb* function from *tmap* to creata a True Color image from the three color bands.

```{r landsatcolor}
tm_shape(landsat)+
  tm_rgb(r=3, # red band
         g=2, # green band
         b=1, # blue band
         max.value = 26000)+
  tm_shape(zion_shp)+
  tm_borders(col="white")+
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom"),text.color = "white")+
  tm_layout(main.title= "Zion National Park",
            title="True Color Image",
            title.position = c("right","top"),
            title.color = "white"
            )

```

Often, researchers use the color bands from Landsat to derive various data not visible to the naked eye. For instance, in the infrared, water is highly absorbing, and trees generally emit in the IR. We can create a false color image by swapping out IR for red. 

```{r falsecolor}
tm_shape(landsat)+
  tm_rgb(r=4, # nearIR band
         g=2, # green band
         b=1, # blue band
         max.value = 32000)+
  tm_shape(zion_shp)+
  tm_borders(col="white")+
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom"),text.color = "white")+
  tm_layout(main.title= "Zion National Park",
            title="False Color Image",
            title.position = c("right","top"),
            title.color = "white"
            )
```

Notice how the lake in the upper middle remains dark, while the forest in the upper portion shows up as very red. You can see the vegetation along the stream channel in the lower part of the image as well.
